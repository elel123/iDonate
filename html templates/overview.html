  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>The two biggest things that usually cause patients to lose out on donating are iron count and hydration count. This app structures itself so that it not only provides you a detailed guide to a successful donation, but also keeps you on track along the way through daily reminders. </li>
    <li>Especially for menstruating females or those that fall vegetarian or vegan diets, being able to pass that iron count proves difficult that the average person, as their iron levels tend to be historically lower than the average person. For menstruating females, an iron count of 12.5 ml/g can be hard to reach because of the constant deflux of iron from the body through periods. Vegetarians and vegans stand on a similar note as well, as their dietary choices reduces the amount of absorbable iron that enters their bloodstream, so it takes a more meticulous diet to keep it on par with blood donation requirements.
</li>    
    <li>For non-vegetarians, keeping a healthy iron count requires the absorption of iron rich foods 7 - 10 days before their donation appointment such as:
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>Meats such as beef, lamb, ham, and turkey</li>
      <li>Seafood such as shrimp, clams, and scallops</li>
      <li>Grains such as whole wheat bread, rye bread, and oatmeal</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For vegetarians and vegans, dietary choices that are high in iron are a little bit harder to find and require a lot more quantity to produce the same effect as a non-vegetarian diet. In general, eat 1.8 times the normal quantity of the following items that you would usually eat to keep track: </li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Fruit such as watermelon, strawberries, figs, prunes</li>
        <li>Dried fruit such as dried apricots and dried peaches</li>
        <li>Protein sources such as dried beans, tofu, and lentils</li>
      </ul>
    <li>If you have notifications turned on, we will remind you to hydrate and eat iron rich foods for each meal, often giving you the challenge of incorporating one random one with whatever meal youâ€™re having. Post a picture of it on social media, and tag us!
